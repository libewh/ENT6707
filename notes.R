#bumble bee flight distances
#H0: no difference in flight distances between species
#Experimental Unit: individual bumble bee
#Unit of Observation: individual bumble bee (each row of data sheet)
#in this case, the EU and UO are the same and they are each row of the data sheet

#exprimental design: key principles
#explain its importance in designing robust experiments
#explain how each would be achieved "in the real world"
  #randomization -> generators, 
  #replication -> 
  #reduction of noise -> have control, account for other variables,
